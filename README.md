# Python_Sandcastles
Challenge from Code in Place.
This program generates simple addition problems that involve adding two 2-digit integers
(i.e., the numbers 1 through 9). The user is asked for an answer to each problem. The program determines
if the answer was correct or not, and gives the user an appropriate message to let them know. The program
keeps giving the user problems until the user has gotten 3 problems correct in a row.
